.TH ATASM 1 "April 2015" "Contributed Software"
.SH NAME
atasm \- assembler targeted for the 6502 CPU with Atari-specific features
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BI "atasm [" options "] " filename
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B atasm
assembles 6502 code to an Atari DOS executable, an Atari XFD
disk image, or a raw binary file.
.PP
The syntax used is compatible with the Atari 8-bit assembler MAC/65,
with a few extensions (notably 6502 illegal opcode support)
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-o" filename
saves the object file to
.IR filename
instead of
.IR sourcefile
[.65o]

.TP
.BI "\-D" symbol=value
Defines
.IR symbol
to
.IR value
before assembly begins. This is equivalent to inserting a line like
.BR symbol=value
before the first line of the source file.

.TP
.BI "\-I" directory
specifies a search directory for .INCLUDE directives

.TP
.BI "\-v"
prints assembly trace.

.TP
.BI "\-s"
prints symbol table when assembly is completed.

.TP
.BI "\-u"
enables undocumented opcodes.  This is equivalent to using the
.BR .OPT ILL
in the source file.  Notice that this command-line paramter is overriden by any directives
in the source files.

.TP
.BI "\-m" filename
defines the template emulator state file.

.TP
.BI "\-x" filename
saves object file to .XFD image
.IR filename

.TP
.BI "\-r"
saves object code as a raw binary image

.TP
.BI "\-f" value
set the raw binary fill byte to
.IR value
.  Note that if you specify this value in hex, it will probably need to be escaped.
